To generate HTML documentation and man pages, run:

$ ./generate.py

It requires:
- Python 2.5
- Docutils (tested with 0.4 and 0.5)
- Jinja2 (tested with 2.1.1)
- Pygments (tested with versions from 0.7.1 to 1.0)

For the curious: the site at http://pybtex.sourceforge.net/ is generated and
updated as follows:

$ ./generate.py site
